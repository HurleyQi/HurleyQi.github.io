This project contains code for a Convolution Long Short-Term Memory Networks (CNN-LSTM) 
deep learning model.

CNN utilizes convolution to captures local features and pooling to prevent redundancy. 
A stack of LSTMs, which is typically used for sequential data,
is then connected to the end of CNN with the hopes of capturing sequential relationships.

We utilized the [DARTS](https://unit8co.github.io/darts/) Library to enhance functionality 
and streamline development. Our model can be used in similar form as all other DARTS Forecasting Models.
