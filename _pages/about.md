I am currently a Computer Science and Mathematics student at [UT Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/). I am passionate about applying the methods and advancements of computer science to other scientific disciplines, especially biology and medicine. My primary interests are in studying computational biology, machine learning, and computational medicine.

My currency goal is to pursue a Ph.D. in Computer Science to further develop my skills and expertise in these areas. My research experience includes applying machine learning models to predict DNA functional activity at Dr. Stephen Yi’s Lab. Currently, I am a summer research intern, provided through the [Moncrief Summer Internship Program](https://oden.utexas.edu/academics/undergraduates/moncrief-summer-internship/), at the [PHYZ Lab](https://phyzlab.org/) at UT’s Dell Medical School, working on applying machine learning and mathematical forecasting methods to NICU health data. Additionally, I am an undergraduate research assistant at Dr. [Can Cenik’s Lab](https://ceniklab.github.io/), focusing on computational techniques related to protein abundance and gene expression studies.

I am a big fan of Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings. In my free time, I enjoy reading mystery novels and watching professional chess and tennis. Having grown up in China, I am fluent in Mandarin.

Feel free to contact me if we share any interests.

Special thanks to Maruan Al-Shedivat for the fantastic website template.
