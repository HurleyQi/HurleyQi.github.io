I am currently a Computer Science and Mathematics student at [UT Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/). My research largely 
focuses on developing computational tools to analyze large molecular datasets at the translational level and utilizing clinical physiological data to model patient health and treatment response. My primary interests are in computational biology, computational medicine, bioinformatics, machine learning, and high performance computing. 

My current goal is to pursue a Ph.D. in Computer Science to further develop my skills and expertise in these areas. My research experience includes applying machine learning models to predict DNA functional activity at the [Livestrong Cancer Institutes](https://dellmed.utexas.edu/units/livestrong-cancer-institutes). I was a summer research intern, provided through the [Moncrief Summer Internship Program](https://oden.utexas.edu/academics/undergraduates/moncrief-summer-internship/), at the [PHYZ Lab](https://phyzlab.org/) at UT’s Dell Medical School, where I worked on applying deep learning forecasting methods to preterm infants' health data under
the supervision of Dr. Joshua Chang. Currently, I am an undergraduate research assistant at [Dr. Can Cenik’s Lab](https://ceniklab.github.io/), focusing on applying graph neural networks to predict gene/protein functions. 

In addition to my research experience, I have gained classroom experience as a course assistant in the Department of Mathematics. I am also interested in the administrative aspects of graduate studies, currently serving as a student associate at the administrative office of the Oden Institute.

I am a big fan of Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings. In my free time, I enjoy reading mystery novels and watching professional chess and tennis. Having grown up in China, I am fluent in Mandarin.

Feel free to contact me if we share any interests.
