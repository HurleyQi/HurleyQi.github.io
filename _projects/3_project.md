This C++-based project provides a functioning operating system kernel on x86-32 bit architecture. 
It features support for interrupts, multi-threading, virtual memory, file systems, kernel-user 
seperation, and is capable of operating on a multi-processing system.

The kernel also supports hardware interrupts, PS/2 keyboard inputs, and 
includes graphics rendering capabilities for playing Donkey Kong.
