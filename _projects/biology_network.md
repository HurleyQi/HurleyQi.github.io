**Abstract:** Biological networks capture a wide range of interactions and relationships between bi- ological entities, and have proven valuable for gaining insights and addressing key chal- lenges. As the size and complexity of these networks continue to grow, understanding their potential applications becomes increasingly important. In this manuscript, we explore the integration of graph theory into computational biology and demonstrate several applications of this approach. We aim to highlight the usefulness of graph- based methods in biological research and motivate further advancements in this field.
