This project contains code supporting the periodicity analysis presented in the paper titled
"Translation efficiency covariation across cell types is a conserved organizing principle of 
mammalian transcriptomes." 

Three-nucleotide periodicity is a unique feature of ribosome profiling data. 
It is a bias in the mapped read counts towards one of the three reading frames. We developed a tool
to quantify the triplet-periodicity for ribosome profiling data processed with RiboFlow.
